FEATURES:
-> Customizeable settings based on language!
For example, colors can be set based on the language, text can be set in the language, images, etc. As long as it is in the correct folder, it can show up.
-> Search dictionaries!
Can choose what dictionaries to add. Can easily create more (look in the folders for more details).
-> Add unknown words to a repository!
Can search a word, then add it to a list of unknowns. This list can then be uploaded to GoogleSheets or saved as a CSV. 
-> Sorted by frequency!
Great for seeing what words you should learn first. Each backup (whether it be CSV or GoogleSheets) is automatically sorted by frequency. It will show the relative frequency value as well (in form: "Word" "Frequency number").
-> Backup system!
Each upload to Google Sheets lets you backup to a local drive.

HELP WITH SHEETS:
Watch this video to get the correct JSON file. It should also help with understanding how the connection to sheets is made.
